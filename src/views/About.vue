          <h5>Who Are We</h5>
          <h1>The Sneaker Exchange</h1>
          <p>
            Based in Chicago, USA. Our goal is to provide sneakerheads with rare gems from around the sneaker world.
            Some sneakers have become increasingly rare over time and sometimes coming across a pair nowadays is
            extremely difficult especially in the right size. The 1999-2004 era was one of the best sneaker releases in
            history in our opinion. All our prices listed are in US Dollars. This app is meant for people who want to
            find an alternative to buying, selling, or trading sneakers and rare kicks. To use this app you first have
            to signup, and post a listing for sale and link up with people in your local community to make the sale!
